    <h1>Greek Farro Salad</h1>

    <H1>Description</H1>
        <p> 
        
        This is a great alternative to a cold pasta salad as farro doesn't get soggy and holds up to the dressing very well. 
        Farro is an ancient Mediterranean grain, so I wanted to merge it with a Greek-style salad that's perfect for summertime. 
        This is great served with grilled lamb or chicken. Add black olives or fresh herbs to your liking!

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Rinse farro with water; drain. 
            Place farro in a pot; pour in chicken broth to cover farro by at least one inch, adding water if needed.
             Stir in 1 teaspoon olive oil and sea salt.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently,
             until tender, about 35 minutes for whole grain farro or about 20 minutes for pearled farro.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Drain farro, rinse with cold water, 
            and set aside to cool completely, about 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Whisk 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, Greek seasoning, and garlic together in a large bowl. 
            Stir in tomato, cucumber, red pepper, red onion, and feta cheese. 
            Stir farro into tomato mixture until completely coated with dressing; season with salt and pepper. 
            Refrigerate salad for about 2 hours before serving.</p>
